        'For writers, a random sentence can help them get their creative juices flowing. Since the topic of the '
        'sentence is completely unknown, it forces the writer to be creative when the sentence appears. There are a '
        'number of different ways a writer can use the random sentence for creativity. The most common way to use the '
        'sentence is to begin a story. Another option is to include it somewhere in the story. A much more difficult '
        'challenge is to use it to end a story. In any of these cases, it forces the writer to think creatively since '
        'they have no idea what sentence will appear from the tool.',
        'The goal of Python Code is to provide Python tutorials, recipes, problem fixes and articles to beginner and '
        'intermediate Python programmers, as well as sharing knowledge to the world. Python Code aims for making '
        'everyone in the world be able to learn how to code for free. Python is a high-level, interpreted, '
        'general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of '
        'significant indentation. Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming '
        'paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is '
        'often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.',
        'As always, we start with the imports. Because we make the UI with tkinter, we need to import it. We also '
        'import the font module from tkinter to change the fonts on our elements later. We continue by getting the '
        'partial function from functools, it is a genius function that excepts another function as a first argument '
        'and some args and kwargs and it will return a reference to this function with those arguments. This is '
        'especially useful when we want to insert one of our functions to a command argument of a button or a key '
        'binding.'
